## 🗣️ About

> The aim of this project is to code a function that reads a file line by line, manipulating one or more file descriptors.

### 🛠️ Resources i used for code it
[C language Docs](https://www.gnu.org/software/c-intro-and-ref/manual/c-intro-and-ref.html)

Try to learn about open, read and write functions. Also, learn how you can use static variables.

This project is short, so you won't have much work to code it.

## ⚙️ Usage
> To be able to use get_next_line, you'll need to install the gcc compiler, if you don't already have it.</i>
>
> you should create a main.c file to be able to use the get_next_line() function.
> 
> don't forget include the get_next_line.h in the header.
### 📦 Compilation
```sh
$ cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror main.c get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c -o {PROGRAM_NAME_CHOSEN]
```
